If you could see what I see,
You would know love eternal.

Be brave.
Often paralyzed by fear.
Act, and the path will clear.

Sleeping,
Comfort begets death of dreams.
Wake!

Follow the river, past the bend,
The tree, free.
Chain your own thought.
Ask, ask for thy wisdom.

Sweet,
This heart, mine, tenderly.

I love you, always.</div>

                        <div class="poem-text">Opinions are an ease by which any society creates and maintains standards. Those standards are applicable to a portion of the society, rarely all. Simple opinion, take Uggs : you may not have one as you don't wear any. You may be an avid advocate of theirs. You may not like their product yet remain silent, you evoke a sense of neutrality or indifference.

The issue isn't our opinions, rather how we communicate them. The issue is we can't have an unbiased discussion, everything we do is related to a thought, a feeling, a want, a need we've carried our entire lives. Say you make a decision about your life based on the opinions or advice of others it invites a feeling of uneasiness if the decision was bad. Even if it was good, if you were opposed to it in the beginning it still feels foreign. The decision not being your own leaves a bad taste in your mouth. In part opinions have become part of our identity. Opinions were an ease by which society created and maintained standards. Opinions are now armor and weapons used during an argument.

Next time you argue with someone, note how you feel after. You will see the range from winning or losing the argument will fluctuate with external factors ( did anyone raise their voice, did anyone cry, was anyone offended or offensive). The best way to win an argument is not to have the right opinion. It is to speak clearly about things you understand. Having the facts is well in good, but simply spewing them on the table amounts to very little. It amounts to a messy table where no one wants to eat their dinner. How do most people use their opinions thus?

Their use varies deeply depending on culture or the century. Once Humans started thriving on a difference of opinions it became an unstoppable machine. They differed on everything, is the difference to say they are different or are they actually different. A fact I can neither prove nor disprove since it has been embedded into our society as an opinion. If someone had a negative opinion on Uggs, you listing facts from their website would move them very little or not at all, you might in fact reinforce that negative belief. Changing someone's opinion is as hard as getting them to chop off their arm voluntarily. The only real difference between people is what they value vs what they give value to.

If you are entitled to believe what you want then so are others, do not leave your armor at home. In a society where we've been literally numbing ourselves for fear of bearing the full weight of human emotions without a chemical buffer now I must also bear your opinion of me. No thank you, literally.

The spread of misinformation is rampant and serves as building blocks for argumentative opinions. The little territories our ancestors divvied up claiming independence yet unable to survive without human hyper-connectivity is amusing. The interdependence of nations is as contrary to their independent claims as opinions are from fact.</div>
